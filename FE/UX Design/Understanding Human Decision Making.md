Designers must understand how users make decisions, in order to create intuitive and efficient interfaces.

# Factors Influencing Decision Making

- [[General/Notes#Cognitive Biases|Cognitive Biases]]
- Emotions: Emotions can sway decisions, even when people believe they are making rational choices. UX designer should consider how design elements can elicit positive emotions and minimize negative ones.
- Information Overload: Too much information can lead to cognitive overload and negatively impact decision making. UX designers need to organize and present information in a digestible and accessible way.

# Decision Making Models

- Compensatory model: In this model, individuals consider all available options, weighing their pros and cons. UX design implications include providing detailed information, filters, and comparisons to help users make informed decisions.
- Non-compensatory model: 
- Satisficing model: In this approach, users make decisions by selecting first available option that meets their minimum criteria. UX designers should consider implementing features like 'top choices' and recommendations to support this decision-making style

# Design Principles for Supporting Decision Making

- Progressive disclosure: Present information gradually to avoid overwhelming users. This technique can include using tooltips, labels, and expanding sections.
- Cognitive aids: Help users remember important information or tasks by providing timely reminders, notifications, and visual cues.
- Feedback: Instant feedback can help users understand the results of their decisions and guide them towards desired outcomes. This can be achieved through visual cues, messages and animations.
- Defaults: Use smart defaults to help users make decisions in a context-appropriate manner, which could range from pre-filled forms to suggested options.

# Frameworks

## BJ Fogg's Behavior Model (FBM)

- Motivation: This element emphasizes the user's desire to perform a certain action or attain specific outcomes.  Motivation can be linked to three core elements specified as sensation (pleasure/pain), anticipation (hope/fear), and social cohesion (belonging/rejection).
- Ability: Refers to user's capacity, both physical and mental, to perform desired actions. To enhance the ability of users, UX designer should follow the principle of simplicity. The easier to perform an action, the more likely user will engage with the product. Some factors to consider are time, financial resources, physical effort, and cognitive load.
- Triggers: Triggers are cues, notifications or prompts that signal users to take an action. For an action to occur, triggers should be presented at the right time when the user has adequate motivation and ability.
