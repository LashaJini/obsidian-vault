It is a people with whom you made a genuine connection, whether in-person or online, because you have a mutual interest and can gain more value through being connected than you would otherwise have alone.

These are the people you can ask for help, and in turn you can help out later.

Just like building your tech skills, networking requires careful attention and a strategic approach. It will take time to build. 

Consider proactively allocating a percentage of your time to this activity.

## Identify your options

Your time is limited and your options are endless.

Authenticity and mutual respect is important when building genuine connections. People are busy, so try not to approach them with "help me get a job", "be my mentor", it may even seem disrespectful. Building connection is like being on a date and finding potential romantic partner. Try not to make it feel like a chore, or would be hard to maintain the connection. The professional network is like a garden which needs taking care of.
